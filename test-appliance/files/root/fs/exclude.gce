// The test generic/471 tests the RWF_NOWAIT flag; however
// how it is supposed to work with file systems is disputed,
// and not all device drivers support it.  As a result
// it doesn't work if an LVM device driver is in use (as is the
// case with gce-xfstests).  So let's suppress it for now.  For
// more details see:

// This test takes hotplug CPU's off-line and this apparently causes
// an instant reboot.  This doesn't happen on KVM, but it does happen
// when running the same kernel on GCE.
