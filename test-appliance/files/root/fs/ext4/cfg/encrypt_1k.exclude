// exclude file for ext4/encrypt_1k

// n.b.  Due to the 1k block size, ext4/023 and ext4/028 also fail for a
// second reason: they use _scratch_populate_cached() which tries to
// create a 1023-byte symlink, which fails with encrypt_1k because
// encrypted symlinks are limited to blocksize-3 bytes, not
// blocksize-1 as is the case for no encryption.
