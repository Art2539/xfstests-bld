// exclude file for ext4/ext3conv

// ext4/044 tries to mount the file system as ext3 explicitly, but
// since we pass nodelalloc, this test will fail.
ext4/044

// This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
// configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.
generic/027

// The generic/635 test tries to call the shutdown ioctl with the
// LOGFLUSH flag, which unfortunately will does not work well with
// nodelalloc mount option (which the ext3conv configuration uses).
// This is because once we are in shutdown state, any attempt to write
// an inode fails with an EIO --- but this means that the data=ordered
// writeback will fail with an EIO and this causes the LOGFLUSH commit
// fail, which in turn means the $SCRATCH_MNT/t_* files do not survive
// the shutdown, causing generic/635 to fail.  We are not likely going
// to fix this before we rework ext4's writeback strategy to remove the
// data=ordered writeback entirely, so let's just exclude this test for
// now.
