The xfstests-bld package makes it easy to build xfstests in a hermetic
build environment (so it is not dependent on possibly out-of-date
system libraries for libaio, dmapi, etc.).  It also contains scripts
which make it easy to run xfstests in a KVM guest.

Quick directions (which assume you are using a debian guest image; if
you are using another distribution for your guest image, these
instructions may need to be adjusted slightly).

1.  "make tarball" to generate the xfstests.tar.gz file.  This should be
    unpacked in the directory /root of your KVM guest OS image
2.  Copy the files in kvm-autorun to the /root directory on the guest OS
    image
3.  Move /root/rc.local to /etc/rc.local
4.  Move /root/S06mkvdevs.sh to /etc/init.d and create a symlink from
    /etc/init.d/S06mkvdevs.sh to /etc/rc.d/rcS.d
5.  Add entries to /etc/fstab for /dev/vdb, /dev/vdc, and /dev/vdb as
    ext4 file systems mounted on /vdb, /vdc, /vdd respectively.  Make
    sure empty direcotires exist for the /vdb, /vdc, vdd mount points.
6.  The host OS scripts are in kvm-xfststs directory.  You'll need to
    edit the DIR= line in kvm-xfstests, and adjust some of the
    parameters in the kvm-xfstests/config file
