These KVM test appliance images are designed to be used with the
kvm-xfstests system which can be found here:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/ext2/xfstests-bld.git

If you are testing a 32-bit x86 kernel you must use the
root_fs.img.i386.  If you are using a 64-bit kernel, you may use
either the i386 or x86_64 root_fs.img file.

Information on how to use these images can be found at the Quick Start
guide, located at:

    https://github.com/tytso/xfstests-bld/blob/master/Documentation/kvm-quickstart.md
