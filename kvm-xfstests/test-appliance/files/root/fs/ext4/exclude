ext4/304

# generic/042 and generic/392 are failing because ext4 forces the
# resuolution of all delayed allocation writes before allowing the
# punch operation to proceed.  We probably want to see if we can avoid
# this for the future, but what ext4 is doing is legal, so just skip
# the test for now
generic/042
generic/392

# generic/04[456] tests how truncate and delayed allocation works
# ext4 uses the data=ordered to avoid exposing stale data, and
# so it uses a different mechanism than xfs.  So these tests will fail
generic/044
generic/045
generic/046

# generic/223 tests file alignment, which works on ext4 only by
# accident because we're not RAID stripe aware yet, and works at all
# because we have bias towards aligning on power-of-two block numbers.
# It is a flaky test for some configurations, so skip it.
generic/223

# generic/472 is a test which fails for all file systems and all
# kernel versions at least up to 4.15.  The patch to fix it is being
# bikeshedded, with no obvious conclusion.  So let's just suppress the
# test for now since the failure is just noise.
# Patch subject: Return bytes transferred for partial direct I/O
generic/472

# The proposed fix for generic/484, "locks: change POSIX lock
# ownership on execve when files_struct is displaced" would break NFS
# Jeff Layton and Eric Biederman have some ideas for how to address it
# but fixing it is non-trivial
generic/484
